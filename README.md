# Reddit Bot Project
 My first mini-project
 
 I used the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) available on https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/quick_start.html
 
This Reddit bot can read the titles of posts from any subreddit chosen by the user.
It also looks for specific words in each comment on a subreddit post and replies with a comment of its own.

Bot in action:
